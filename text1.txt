[Intro: A$AP Rocky + Juicy J]
Yeah, yeah I'm, y'all know what it is
Yeah I'm, yeah I'm, (shut the fuck up) yeah I'm, yeah I'm, yeah I'm
Yeah I'm

[Chorus: A$AP Rocky & Juicy J]
Yamborghini-high, Lambo by the crib
This is how it is, yeah, these niggas fake
No, we can't relate
Yamborghini-high, Lambo by the crib
This is how it is, this is how we live
Bitches, bitches, bitches, bitches (you know it)
Yamborghini-high, Lambo by the crib
This is how it is, yeah, these niggas fake
No, we can't relate (we do it)
Yamborghini-high, Lambo by the crib
